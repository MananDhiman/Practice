'''A teacher is in the process of generating few reports based on the marks scored by the students of her class in a project based assessment.
Assume that the marks of her 10 students are available in a tuple. The marks are out of 25.

Write a python program to implement the following functions:

1. find_more_than_average(): Find and return the percentage of students who have scored more than the average mark of the class.

2. generate_frequency(): Find how many students have scored the same marks. For example, how many have scored 0, how many have scored 1, how many have scored 3â€¦.how many have scored 25. The result should be populated in a list and returned.

3. sort_marks(): Sort the marks in the increasing order from 0 to 25. The sorted values should be populated in a list and returned.'''
